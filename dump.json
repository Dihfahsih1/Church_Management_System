It deals with the reason why someone is in existence. It is important for each one of us to discover why they are alive. So many people have failed to discover the purpose of their lives and many have actually come to the end of their \u2018journeys\u2019 without getting the slightest idea of why they ever lived.\r\nThe scriptures teach us that the of spirit \u201cmankind\u201d existed long before the creation of the world.\r\nThe creation of mankind happened in the eternity before God created any other thing in the physical world.\r\nWisdom  who is Christ , in Proverbs tell the story of what happened before the physical world was created - Prov 8:22  \r\nAs Christ tell the story he tells us of his moments with mankind in Spiritual world before the physical world was created \r\nVerse 31 \u201cRejoicing in the habitable part of his earth; and my delights were with the sons of men\u201d.\r\n\r\nThe Psalmist through the prayer of Moses also reveals that spirit of mankind lived with God long before coming to the earth. \r\n\r\n \u201cA Prayer of Moses the man of God. Lord, thou hast been our dwelling place in all generations\u201d. Psalms 90:1\r\n\r\nAnd that spirit existed before the body and even the days of mankind were known to God even before he was manifested on earth. \u201cYour eyes saw my unformed Body. All the days ordained for me were written in your book before one of them came to be.

However when you read one that says before we pray he already knows what we need (Mat.6:7- 8), a question comes to mind why then pray?\r\n-\tPrayer times before God could be a moment when God gets our attention with an attitude we are going to let God know what we need, yet he is also ready to share his will with us now that in such times we are focused and attentive \r\n-\tMat.17:1 \u2013 mountain of transfiguration they was a two way communication\r\n-\tExod.3:3 - Moses by the burning bush\u2026I will go over and see\u2026\u201d\r\n-\tPrayer is \u201ctwo way traffic\u201d. During prayer God speaks back and reveals His will to someone in a particular area of their concern. . \r\n\uf076\tRevelation; \r\n-\tThis is to disclose, to enlighten or illuminate\r\n-\tGod sometimes uses dreams when revealing to us his will\r\n-\tMany times God communicates to mankind through visions and dreams as he reveals his heart. Examples of people that God spoke to in dreams and visions include Joseph, Paul, Jeremiah, David, Peter e.t.c. \r\n-\tEph.1: 17 -18 -  That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him:\r\n18 The eyes of your understanding being enlightened; that ye may know what is the hope of his calling, and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints,\r\n-\tRoms 11:8-10 -   (According as it is written, God hath given them the spirit of slumber, eyes that they should not see, and ears that they should not hear;) unto this day.\r\n9 And David saith, Let their table be made a snare, and a trap, and a stumblingblock, and a recompence unto them:\r\n10 Let their eyes be darkened, that they may not see, and bow down their back alway.\r\n-\tLuk.24:16, 31 -   But their eyes were holden that they should not know him\r\nVs.31 -  And their eyes were opened, and they knew him; and he vanished out of their sight.\r\n-\tProv.25:2 -  It is the glory of God to conceal a thing: but the honour of kings is to search out a matter\r\n\uf076\tDeut.29:29 -  The secret things belong unto the LORD our God: but those things which are revealed belong unto us and to our children for ever, that we may do all the words of this law \r\n\r\n\uf076\tConviction of the heart.- This is one of the most common ways by which God makes his will known to mankind. Conviction is easy because it involves ones heart yet some of the other ways are somehow difficult because one has to be concentrated in order to know God\u2019s will. It becomes even easier if one has got a heart of flesh and not a\u201d strong heart\u201d. \u201cI will give you a new heart and put a new spirit in you: I will remove from you your heart of stone and give you a heart of fresh. And I will put my spirit in you and move you to follow my decree and be care free to keep my laws. \u201cEzekiel 36:26-27\r\n\r\nA heart of flesh is one that easily melts when God moves it which is unlike for a strong one.\r\nGod can put it upon ones heart to do something as the case was for Nehemiah \u201c I went to Jerusalem, and after staying there three days I set out during the night with a few men. I had not told anyone what my God had put in my heart to do for Jerusalem. There were no mounts with me except the one I was riding on.\u201d Nehemiah: 2:11-12  \r\n\uf076\tGod\u2019s Word; \r\n\uf0a7\tThrough God\u2019s written word or \u201cLOGOS\u201d; \r\n\uf0a7\t2Timothy 3:16 - All scripture [is] given by inspiration of God, and [is] profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness:\r\n \r\n-\tEven when Christ came into this world, he did God\u2019s will by living according to scriptures\r\n-\tLuke 4:21 And he began to say unto them, This day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears.\r\n-\tJohn 19:28 After this, Jesus knowing that all things were now accomplished, that the scripture might be fulfilled, saith, I thirst.\r\n\r\n-\tJohn 19:36 For these things were done, that the scripture should be fulfilled, A bone of him shall not be broken.\r\n\r\n-\tJohn 19:37 And again another scripture saith, They shall look on him whom they pierced.\r\n\r\n-\tJohn 20:9 For as yet they knew not the scripture, that he must rise again from the dead.\r\n-\t\r\n\uf0a7\tThrough God\u2019s spoken word or \u201cRHEMA\u201d; \r\n\uf0a7\tThrough prophesies; \r\n\uf0a7\tThrough Word of knowledge (according to Isaiah 34:16 the word of God has every detail Ezekiel 3:1- eats the scroll and Jeremiah 15:16 - also ate God\u2019s word.\r\n\uf0a7\tThrough leaders; God puts us under someone for a purpose and He expects us to submit under that authority. He uses such leaders to groom us into the people that He wants us to be. So God can communicate to people through their leaders. For example God used Moses and Joshua to communicate to the Israelites as He used Paul to speak to Timothy.
