The inner burning\r\n\r\n2. An upright heart\r\n\r\n3. What can a Christian do amidst the storm\r\n\r\n4. Why are you Alive	‘‘WHY ARE YOU ALIVE’’\r\nIntroduction \r\nThis is a very fundamental question in our lives. It deals with the reason why someone is in existence. It is important for each one of us to discover why they are alive. So many people have failed to discover the purpose of their lives and many have actually come to the end of their ‘journeys’ without getting the slightest idea of why they ever lived.\r\nThe scriptures teach us that the of spirit “mankind” existed long before the creation of the world.\r\nThe creation of mankind happened in the eternity before God created any other thing in the physical world.\r\nWisdom  who is Christ , in Proverbs tell the story of what happened before the physical world was created - Prov 8:22  \r\nAs Christ tell the story he tells us of his moments with mankind in Spiritual world before the physical world was created \r\nVerse 31 “Rejoicing in the habitable part of his earth; and my delights were with the sons of men”.\r\n\r\nThe Psalmist through the prayer of Moses also reveals that spirit of mankind lived with God long before coming to the earth. \r\n\r\n “A Prayer of Moses the man of God. Lord, thou hast been our dwelling place in all generations”. Psalms 90:1\r\n\r\nAnd that spirit existed before the body and even the days of mankind were known to God even before he was manifested on earth. “Your eyes saw my unformed Body. All the days ordained for me were written in your book before one of them came to be. Psalm 139:16.\r\nThis actually explains why man’s spirit has got to return “to God, who gave it.” Ecclesiastes 12:7	Yes	Whenever God calls you to serve him for a long time commission, it’s very important to know what he has called you to and how to do it. Sometimes he may not give you the full details, but at least he always shows you the start and the end of that Commission. The vision is very important because it will be a guideline and a focus as you execute the commission.\r\n\r\nA vision being is a revelation of the full picture of God’s plan, will or purpose; it’s the ultimate goal that one should target to get to\r\nAs Ucc Bwaise, God has given us a focus of what He wants us to follow and emphasise in this ministry – Discovering and Doing God’s will.\r\n\r\nWe shall therefore divide this Vision in 3 segments\r\n1.\tGod’s will\r\n\r\n2.\tDiscovering\r\n\r\n3.\tDoing God’s will \r\n\r\nIn this Church vision, the core value is God’s will and therefore we must well understand it before we dare to discover and then go on doing it\r\nGod’s will is God’s heart, plan, choice, purpose, desire, and future over someone or something. This will is not obvious unto every one, it calls for discover after that you can then go on and do exactly that. \r\nGod’s will either refers to what He wants or does not want at a particular moment.\r\n\r\nThe does and don’ts are two things that even make up the commandments of God and the word of God.	Meaning of a Vision
4	about/IMG_3458.JPG		God predestined a lot of things about mankind. He knows each person and He selected them for His purpose. According to the Bible, even before one is born, they are known to God.\r\n  “I knew you before I formed you in your mother’s womb.” Jeremiah 1: 5\r\n29”For God knew his people in advance, and he chose them to become like his Son, so that his son would be the firstborn, with many brothers and sister. 30 And having chosen them, he called them to come to him. And he gave them right standing with himself, and he promised them his glory.” Romans 8:29-30\r\n\r\nIt’s God who chose when the spirit mankind should come on planet earth and definitely when it shall return to Him.  God determines birthdays and death days as the Bible states that ‘The length of man’s life is decided beforehand.’ Job 14:5\r\n\r\nThe best way you can get to know why you are alive is by getting to know your origin. The Bible states in Genesis 1:26 that “Then God said, “And now we will make human beings; they will be like us and resemble us. They will have power over the fish, the birds and all animals, domestic and wild, large and small. So God created human beings, making them to be like to him. He created them male and female. In his own image in the image of God created He him male and female.”\r\nBeing in the image of God means that man is a spiritual being dwelling in the physical world walking a physical journey. Otherwise,   the citizenship of mankind is in heaven as stated by Paul in Philippians 3:20.  However, God determines sets the times for every mankind and the exact places where they should live. He brings one forth at a point in time to move them in His own direction. Man is God’s messenger, a person sent from Heaven with a peculiar mission on earth.\r\n “Iam the one who spoke and called him; I led him out and gave him success. Now come close to me and hear what I say. From the beginning I have spoken openly and have always made my words come true. The Holy God of Israel, the Lord who saves, says Iam the Lord your God, the one who wants to teach you for your own good and direct you in the way you should go.” Isaiah 48:15-17 \r\n\r\nThe Bible sometimes refers to human beings as ‘Christ’s Ambassadors’ 1 Corinthians 5:20 to show that man is a representative of the heavenly kingdom here on earth. As an ambassador, man is on a heavenly mission on earth. He is an instrument of transformation that is supposed to bring about change in places or systems wherever they go. Man is specifically designed and set apart for a particular purpose (Jeremiah 1:5) which purpose is ordained by God to be a fulfilment in lives of other people; families, nations and generally the entire creation. Man is a part of God’s original project and according to (Psalms 139:16) God scheduled every day of your life before you came to be.	Yes	-\tIndividual\r\n-\tGeneral\r\n-\tSeasonal\r\n-\tContributional / Personal\r\n\r\nI strongly believe that a lot of things happened before creation and basically before Mankind came on this planet Earth\r\nGod never does something for nothing!\r\n•\tWhy bring man on Earth\r\n-\tWhen the devil was thrown here the earth became hell of a place\r\n-\tNo barren Spirit- Messenger without message\r\n-\tProv. 8:22 Vs 31 - Wisdom (Christ tells the story of creation)\r\n-\tGen 1:26 -Let us make man.... so that....\r\n-\tJer 1:5, 1sh 49:1, \r\n•\tHow should man look like\r\n-\tEarthly  vessels for Spirit man Eccl 12:7( Male and Female)\r\n-\tSoul Spirit and Body\r\n-\tPs 139:14, 1 Jn 3:1, Jn 9:2\r\n•\tHow long should man live for – Birth day and Death days set\r\nPs 39:4, Job 14:5, Ps 90:12\r\n•\tWhere should the Spirit called mankind be de1ivered / stay\r\n-\tLocation and Parents\r\n-\tActs 17:24 -27\r\n-\tIsh 51:1, Deut 32: 18, 1cor 10:4- drank from same spiritual rock Christ but we are all different in many ways.\r\n\r\n\r\nADAMIC FALL AWAY AND CONSEQUENCES \r\nThis brought a roundabout in the plan and mission of God on planet earth - it became a rescue mission\r\n•\tMankind was created upright – Eccl 7:29\r\n•\tWhen sinned, he was Corrupted, Corroded Dis-figured \r\nNeed for Rescue; -\r\n-\t Revival\r\n-\t Restoration\r\n-\t Salvation \r\n-\tRomans 3:23  - For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;\r\n-\tRomans 5:12 - Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned:\r\n-\t\r\n•\tChrist came to seek and save the lost -  Luke 19:10\r\n\r\n\tIn this great rescue mission where there is reviving, restoring and saving mankind, a lot of work has to be done and Christ is the author of that great work -\r\n-\tHeb. 5:9 And being made perfect, he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him;\r\n-\tHeb. 12:2 Looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith; who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God.\r\n-\tEphes. 4:8 Wherefore he saith, when he ascended up on high, he led captivity captive, and gave gifts unto men.\r\n\tNow that Christ started it, he gives us a great mission of reconciling mankind to God through different gifts and callings. Every one of us has a task therefore to discover oneself as in how did God prepare him or her to best serve his will \r\n-\t2Cor. 5:18 And all things are of God, who hath reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ, and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation;\r\nVs.19 To wit, that God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them; and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation. \r\n\tEvery one of us has a task of discovering and doing God’s will in the few years God gives you to live on this planet.	Types of God’s will
5	about/IMG_3468.JPG		WHO ASKS WHY YOU ARE ALIVE?\r\nThe question “Why one is alive” can be asked by God, by fellow men or the individual Christian. \r\nIt is a very fundamental question which each one of should take time to meditate upon or else we abuse our stay on earth. This booklet is meant to help you to discover the reasons why you were created and why you are still on the face of the world. It will help you to know the reason and purpose for your being alive and how to set goals and ways of achieving a fulfilled life.\r\nWhen you are able to fully understand why you are alive, you will be able to make a difference during your time. This will enhance the quality of your life and set you on the road to success and fulfilment.\r\nBut this will take the spirit of the Lord; you will need to humble yourself before God to be able to know His will for your life. Whatever it is, the reason for your ‘being’ has a lot to do with your ‘creator’. \r\nThe only possible reason why you appeared in a particular city, town or even family was for you to be released to your own generation to serve mankind and bring all things in your sphere of influence under the ruler ship of Christ. As it is stated in 1Corinthians 10:31 \r\n\r\n1.\tBY GOD\r\nThrough the word of God we come to learn about man’s pre existence before coming into this world and therefore, there must be a reason why God decided to bring man on earth. There must have been a Godly plan which is called ‘God’s will’. \r\nGenerations after generations, God has been sending ‘lives’ on the planet earth for a specific period of time.  During the given number of days, months or years that one lives, God keeps checking on man’s progress but sometimes He wonders why some people, are still alive since they don’t seem to be doing what He sent them to do. This is very unfortunate and the Bible says that “The axe is already at the root of the trees, and every tree that does not produce good fruit will be cut down and thrown in fire.” Mathew 3:10\r\n\r\nMan is not an accident but a person appointed to be God’s servant even before he existed. According to Jeremiah 1:5, man has been set apart and appointed as God’s spokesperson. This means that each person has got what it takes to do God’s will. Whatever gifts God gives someone, He gives them so that one in turn gives them away in service to God. Everyone was created to share their life and talents with the community around them. When we become believers we also become God’s messengers. He wants to speak to the world through us and whatever we have gone through should be a message that God wants us to teach to others.	Yes	Each one of us was given a divine mission and God has a purpose for each one that is different from any other person’s. However, many people are unable to walk according to God’s divine calendar. \r\nDiscovering God’s will is very vital because it enables us to know what He wants us to do and what He does not want us to do. The Bible states that “It’s God’s privilege to conceal things and the king’s privilege to discover them.”Prov25:2\r\nIt’s a challenge for everyone who really wants to live for God and not for themselves to seek to discover God’s will. God’s will can be discovered in several ways including; \r\n\tNow that God’s will is not obvious to many people, there isn’t any of us upon whom God doesn’t have purpose! It leaves us with a challenge which we must solve – why am I alive?\r\n\tOur God communicates to us in many ways now that our understanding and perception is also diverse; some easily understand by hearing once and several time while others do by seeing, yet others need both.  \r\n\tGod communicates to us in several ways as he shares with us his heart though many times we still do not understand but that doesn’t stop his endeavours\r\n\tIt makes this communication easy if the one he is communicating to is very interested and therefore anxious or even attentive – 1Sam 3:1-9\r\n\tWe can therefore know his will through some of the following ways;-	HOW DO WE DISCOVER GOD’S WILL

2	Dihfahsih Mugoya	dihfahsihm@gmail.com	0751612792	\N		Spiritual Growth - What is it?\r\nSpiritual growth is detailed in 2 Peter 1:3-8, "His divine power has given us everything we need for life and godliness through our knowledge of him who called us by his own glory and goodness. Through these he has given us his very great and precious promises, so that through them you may participate in the divine nature and escape the corruption in the world caused by evil desires. For this very reason, make every effort to add to your faith goodness; and to goodness, knowledge; and to knowledge, self-control; and to self-control, perseverance; and to perseverance, godliness; and to godliness, brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness, love. For if you possess these qualities in increasing measure, they will keep you from being ineffective and unproductive in your knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ."
3	Kim Jane	lo@gmail.com	094889800	\N		Spiritual Growth - How is it done?\r\nIn order for spiritual growth to occur, you first need to make sure you possess a true spiritual life through faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. "And this is the testimony: God has given us eternal life, and this life is in his Son. He who has the Son has life; he who does not have the Son of God does not have life" (1 John 5:11-12). When you believe in Jesus Christ, the Holy Spirit lives inside of you (John 14:16-17) and you are a new creation in Christ! 2 Corinthians 5:17 says, "Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; the old has gone, the new has come!" Your old nature, which is dominated by sin, is replaced with a new nature that is under the influence of God's Spirit (Romans 6-7). Spiritual growth can only occur in a person who knows the Lord Jesus Christ as his or her Savior.

4	CHURCH MISSION  ‘‘WHY ARE YOU ALIVE’’	2020-02-06	images/IMG_3487_37EkVRQ.JPG	Introduction \r\nThis is a very fundamental question in our lives. It deals with the reason why someone is in existence. It is important for each one of us to discover why they are alive. So many people have failed to discover the purpose of their lives and many have actually come to the end of their ‘journeys’ without getting the slightest idea of why they ever lived.\r\nThe scriptures teach us that the of spirit “mankind” existed long before the creation of the world.\r\nThe creation of mankind happened in the eternity before God created any other thing in the physical world.\r\nWisdom  who is Christ , in Proverbs tell the story of what happened before the physical world was created - Prov 8:22  \r\nAs Christ tell the story he tells us of his moments with mankind in Spiritual world before the physical world was created \r\nVerse 31 “Rejoicing in the habitable part of his earth; and my delights were with the sons of men”.\r\n\r\nThe Psalmist through the prayer of Moses also reveals that spirit of mankind lived with God long before coming to the earth. \r\n\r\n “A Prayer of Moses the man of God. Lord, thou hast been our dwelling place in all generations”. Psalms 90:1	Yes	1
5	HOW DO WE DISCOVER GOD’S WILL	2020-02-13	images/IMG_3528.JPG	Each one of us was given a divine mission and God has a purpose for each one that is different from any other person’s. However, many people are unable to walk according to God’s divine calendar. \r\nDiscovering God’s will is very vital because it enables us to know what He wants us to do and what He does not want us to do. The Bible states that “It’s God’s privilege to conceal things and the king’s privilege to discover them.”Prov25:2\r\nIt’s a challenge for everyone who really wants to live for God and not for themselves to seek to discover God’s will. God’s will can be discovered in several ways including; \r\n\tNow that God’s will is not obvious to many people, there isn’t any of us upon whom God doesn’t have purpose! It leaves us with a challenge which we must solve – why am I alive?\r\n\tOur God communicates to us in many ways now that our understanding and perception is also diverse; some easily understand by hearing once and several time while others do by seeing, yet others need both.  \r\n\tGod communicates to us in several ways as he shares with us his heart though many times we still do not understand but that doesn’t stop his endeavours\r\n\tIt makes this communication easy if the one he is communicating to is very interested and therefore anxious or even attentive – 1Sam 3:1-9\r\n\tWe can therefore know his will through some of the following ways;-	Yes	Admin
6	WAYS OF DISCOVERING GOD'S WILL	2020-02-13	images/IMG_3489.JPG	\tPrayer; \r\n-\tTo us prayer is all about letting God know what we need, well some of the scriptures about prayer when read will give you this view. However when you read one that says before we pray he already knows what we need (Mat.6:7- 8), a question comes to mind why then pray?\r\n-\tPrayer times before God could be a moment when God gets our attention with an attitude we are going to let God know what we need, yet he is also ready to share his will with us now that in such times we are focused and attentive \r\n-\tMat.17:1 – mountain of transfiguration they was a two way communication\r\n-\tExod.3:3 - Moses by the burning bush…I will go over and see…”\r\n-\tPrayer is “two way traffic”. During prayer God speaks back and reveals His will to someone in a particular area of their concern. . \r\n\tRevelation; \r\n-\tThis is to disclose, to enlighten or illuminate\r\n-\tGod sometimes uses dreams when revealing to us his will\r\n-\tMany times God communicates to mankind through visions and dreams as he reveals his heart. Examples of people that God spoke to in dreams and visions include Joseph, Paul, Jeremiah, David, Peter e.t.c. \r\n-\tEph.1: 17 -18 -  That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him:\r\n18 The eyes of your understanding being enlightened; that ye may know what is the hope of his calling, and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints,\r\n-\tRoms 11:8-10 -   (According as it is written, God hath given them the spirit of slumber, eyes that they should not see, and ears that they should not hear;) unto this day.\r\n9 And David saith, Let their table be made a snare, and a trap, and a stumblingblock, and a recompence unto them:\r\n10 Let their eyes be darkened, that they may not see, and bow down their back alway.\r\n-\tLuk.24:16, 31 -   But their eyes were holden that they should not know him\r\nVs.31 -  And their eyes were opened, and they knew him; and he vanished out of their sight.\r\n-\tProv.25:2 -  It is the glory of God to conceal a thing: but the honour of kings is to search out a matter\r\n\tDeut.29:29 -  The secret things belong unto the LORD our God: but those things which are revealed belong unto us and to our children for ever, that we may do all the words of this law \r\n\r\n\tConviction of the heart.- This is one of the most common ways by which God makes his will known to mankind. Conviction is easy because it involves ones heart yet some of the other ways are somehow difficult because one has to be concentrated in order to know God’s will. It becomes even easier if one has got a heart of flesh and not a” strong heart”. “I will give you a new heart and put a new spirit in you: I will remove from you your heart of stone and give you a heart of fresh. And I will put my spirit in you and move you to follow my decree and be care free to keep my laws. “Ezekiel 36:26-27\r\n\r\nA heart of flesh is one that easily melts when God moves it which is unlike for a strong one.\r\nGod can put it upon ones heart to do something as the case was for Nehemiah “ I went to Jerusalem, and after staying there three days I set out during the night with a few men. I had not told anyone what my God had put in my heart to do for Jerusalem. There were no mounts with me except the one I was riding on.” Nehemiah: 2:11-12  \r\n\tGod’s Word; \r\n\tThrough God’s written word or “LOGOS”; \r\n\t2Timothy 3:16 - All scripture [is] given by inspiration of God, and [is] profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness:\r\n \r\n-\tEven when Christ came into this world, he did God’s will by living according to scriptures\r\n-\tLuke 4:21 And he began to say unto them, This day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears.\r\n-\tJohn 19:28 After this, Jesus knowing that all things were now accomplished, that the scripture might be fulfilled, saith, I thirst.\r\n\r\n-\tJohn 19:36 For these things were done, that the scripture should be fulfilled, A bone of him shall not be broken.\r\n\r\n-\tJohn 19:37 And again another scripture saith, They shall look on him whom they pierced.\r\n\r\n-\tJohn 20:9 For as yet they knew not the scripture, that he must rise again from the dead.\r\n-\t\r\n\tThrough God’s spoken word or “RHEMA”; \r\n\tThrough prophesies; \r\n\tThrough Word of knowledge (according to Isaiah 34:16 the word of God has every detail Ezekiel 3:1- eats the scroll and Jeremiah 15:16 - also ate God’s word.\r\n\tThrough leaders; God puts us under someone for a purpose and He expects us to submit under that authority. He uses such leaders to groom us into the people that He wants us to be. So God can communicate to people through their leaders. For example God used Moses and Joshua to communicate to the Israelites as He used Paul to speak to Timothy. Deuteronomy 34:9 and 1Timothy 4:14 respectively. \r\n\r\n\r\n\tTendencies and repeated challenges facing you\r\n-\tThere are things in life that one feels a concern and such a unique care about which is not the same case with other people.\r\n-\tOne may even try to draw the attention of other people to the same concern when for them they do not realise anything as related to issue of concern.\r\n-\t This personal concern many times is a message from God making the specific person notice that need so as to do something about it and so obey the heart of God by doing his will.\r\n-\tSometimes the attraction may even be annoying yet it’s what God wants you to correct or do something about.\r\n-\tSome of these concerns are seasonal yet others are part of one’s life – it’s a sign that one is wired accordingly.\r\n-\tThis tendency is like putting a responsibility upon yourself when everyone else is mindless or silent about something – no one chooses you but you choose yourself.\r\n-\tPeter always did this probably little did he know he was later to be a leader , a man of responsibility\r\n\tMat.16:18 – Simon peter answers “ you are the Christ”\r\n\tMatthew 14:28 And Peter answered him and said, Lord, if it be thou, bid me come unto thee on the water.\r\n\tMatthew 19:27 Then answered Peter and said unto him, Behold, we have forsaken all, and followed thee; what shall we have therefore?\r\n\tMatthew 26:58 But Peter followed him afar off unto the high priest's palace, and went in, and sat with the servants, to see the end.\r\n\tMatthew 16:22 Then Peter took him, and began to rebuke him, saying, Be it far from thee, Lord: this shall not be unto thee.\r\n\tMark 9:5 And Peter answered and said to Jesus, Master, it is good for us to be here: and let us make three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias.\r\n\r\nAs  we endeavour to discover and do God’s will, when one asks oneself this question “why are you alive”  it helps very much in refocusing back to roots which is the heart of God where we find the blue print of every one’s divine purpose of creation on this planet.	Yes	PR. Joshua Zake
